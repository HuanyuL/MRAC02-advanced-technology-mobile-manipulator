# MRAC02-Mobile-Manipulator
Authors: [Huanyu Li](https://github.com/HuanyuL), [Marita Georganta](https://github.com/maritaganta)

This repository contains the structure and materials for the **MRAC02 Advanced Technology Seminar**, focusing on mobile manipulators. The seminar covers key technologies used in mobile manipulation, specifically designed for robotic systems utilizing the Husky UR10e mobile platform.

## Course Sections
The course is divided into the following parts:
- **Introduction to ROS 2**: A deep dive into Robot Operating System (ROS 2), its architecture, and how it facilitates communication between robotic components.
- **Introduction to MoveIt 2**: An overview of the MoveIt 2 framework, used for motion planning and control of robotic arms, specifically tailored for the UR10e manipulator.
- **Introduction to Nav2**: Covering the Navigation 2 stack for autonomous navigation of mobile robots like the Husky.
- **Husky UR10e Mobile Manipulator**: Practical integration and control of a Husky robot with the UR10e arm for mobile manipulation tasks.

## Dockerized Environments
Dockerized environments for these components can be found in the following repositories:
- [ros-intro](https://github.com/MRAC-IAAC/MRAC-docker-for-ROS-practice/tree/main/examples)
- [moveit2-intro](#https://github.com/MRAC-IAAC/moveit2-introduction)
- [husky-intro](#)

## Installation
For detailed installation instructions, including Docker setup and workflow, please refer to the [installation](./installation/) folder.

In the `installation` folder, you will find:
- Instructions for setting up Docker
- Steps for working with the Dockerized environments
- Additional setup required for each section of the course

This repository serves as a base for learning, setting up, and executing robotic applications, providing all the necessary resources and documentation for students and developers interested in mobile manipulation systems.
